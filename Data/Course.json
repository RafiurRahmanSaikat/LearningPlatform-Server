        "description": "Welcome this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge and by the end of it you'll be able to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts! This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.",
        "syllabus": "1. Network Hacking - This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired & wireless networks.  First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other.  Then it will branch into three sub sections: Pre-connection ttacks:  in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to gather  information about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections deny/allow devices from connecting to networks).   Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to crack the key and  get the password to your target network whether it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2. Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can  connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive  information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images,  videos ....etc), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and  wired networks. You will also learn how to create a fake WiFi network, attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques  against the connected clients. 2. Gaining Access - In this section you will learn two main approaches to gain full control or hack computer  systems:Server Side Attacks:  In this subsection you will learn how to gain full access to computer systems without user interaction. You  will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its operating system, open ports, installed services,  then use this information to discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities and exploit them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will  learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of reports with your discoveries.Client Side Attacks  - If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by hijacking software updates or backdooring downloads on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how  to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you'll learn how to  create trojans by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if  they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your  trojan.3. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. Youâ€™ll learn how  to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, spy on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and even use the target computer as a pivot to hack other systems.4. Website / Web Application Hacking - In this secti on you will learn how websites work, how to gather information about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc)     and how to discover and exploit the following dangerous vulnerabilities to hack websites"
